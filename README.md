## Project Title
Welcome to Bot Battlr, the one and only spot in the known universe where you can custom build your own Bot Army! 
## Description
Here's the scenario: a galactic overlord has hired you, a galactic web developer, to develop a galactic web app that will allow them to browse through a list of robots, view a robot's details, and, enlist a bot into their army.
## Executing program
As a user, you should be able to:

See profiles of all bots rendered in BotCollection.
Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The selected bot should render in the YourBotArmy component. The bot can be enlisted only once. The bot does not disappear from the BotCollection.
Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the YourBotArmy component.
Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked "x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the YourBotArmy on the frontend.
